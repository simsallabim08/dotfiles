# dotfiles
My personal set of dotfiles for linux and whatever other unix-like systems.

Currently working on a script to install these alongside my preferred programs on openSUSE tumbleweed, but for now just download the files and put them in ~/.config


Also once again cant seem to upload the dots to silly github that says no.
